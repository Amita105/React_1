useContext:

suppose we have a component heiraricy

parent component

component A

component B 

component C

if their is some data in parent component which is 
only needed by child component C 

usually we follow and pass props from one component to other.

with the help of conetxApi , or useContext

a game if some one said to one person : First--second--third--fourth--fifth

so we use useContext API to solve this problem and pass the props 
directly to the child component who needs it. instead of passing it to 
each level.


createContext()

Provider()

Consumer()


first create comA  B  C and return h1 element

lets create context now variables 

firstName 

after createContext we need to export it. else we cannot use it.
